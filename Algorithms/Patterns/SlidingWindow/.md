# Sliding Window

- Sliding Window is a pattern of writing an algorithm for some set of problems. Mostly those that require finding a subarray/substring

- These problems can be solved with Brute Force but it often will generate O(n^2) time complexity

- These problems also deals with linear Data Structures like List/array

- Using this pattern, we can simplify it to O(n) time complexity

> - The pattern uses the idea of window. The window is usually the particular subarray in an array that meets some defined cases and most times, the goal is to work on that window to arrive at the expected result.

> - The Idea is to have a start and end pointer

> - The end pointer is to expand the window until it meets the defined case i.e create a desirable window 

> - The start pointer will now shrink the window until it makes the window undesirable

```js
let minWindow = (s, t) => {
    /*
        "s": the string given to be checked
        "t": the string of letters we are looking for in a substring of "s"
        t[element], t[i], s[element]: the elements or each characters of either "t" or "s"
        Window: the substring of "s"
        Desirable Window: window with an occurnece of each element of string "t"
        right pointer: to expand the window till its desirable
        left pointer: to shrink the window till its undesirable

    // required Variables
    let left = 0, // the left pointer || window start (right is window end)
        count = {}, // hash table declarator || new object instance for "t" count
        missingChar = t.length, // no of char in "t" missing in the window. initially all chars
        min = [0, s.length]; // the minWindow result with start and end points. initially start and end of "s"
        
    //  create "t" count hash table. Key => t[i], Value => 0. Shows how many t[i]s are in the window
    for(let i = 0; i < t.length; i++){
        count[t[i]] = 0; // zero means no t[i] in the current window
    }

    // Ultimate loop over all elements ==0(N)== with "right" as the counter
    for(let right = 0; right < s.length; right++){
        if(s[right] in count){ // if current element is in "t" count 
            if(count[s[right]] === 0){ // if the element count is zero (no t[element] in window) 
                missingChar -= 1; // hence reduce missingChar by 1
            }
            count[s[right]] += 1; // increase the t[element] in "t" count
        }

            if((right - left) < (min[1] - min[0])){ // if current window is lower than old window set minWindow to current window
                min[0] = left;
                min[1] = right;

                if(count[s[left]] === 0){ // if the element in count is zero (no t[element] in window) 
                    missingChar += 1; // increase the missingChar by 1 to make window undesirable
                }

            left += 1; // increase the left pointer by one to shrink window
