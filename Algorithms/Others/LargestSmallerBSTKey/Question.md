# Largest Smaller BST Key
Given a root of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a number num, implement an efficient function findLargestSmallerKey that finds the largest key in the tree that is smaller than num. If such a number doesn’t exist, return -1. Assume that all keys in the tree are nonnegative.

Analyze the time and space complexities of your solution.

### For example:
```
For num = 17 and the binary search tree below:
                20
                /\
               9  25
              /\
             5 12
               /\
              11 14

Your function would return:
14 since it’s the largest key in the tree that is still smaller than 17.
        
```
### Constraints:
```
[time limit] 5000ms
[input] Node rootNode
[output] integer
```
