# Gauss Formula

The Gauss Formula (helps get the perfect sum of consecutive numbers)

A complete explanation can be found [here](http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/qq/database/qq.02.06/jo1.html)

==> `S = n[2a+(n-1)d]/2` if starts with any number or `(n * (n + 1))/2` if starts with 1

where: 
- S = perfect sum
- n = number of terms to be summed
- a = first term
- d = difference between terms
